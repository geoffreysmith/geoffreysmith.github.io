After spending most of my career working with a CMS in some capacity, I decided to consolidate my experience and lessons learned into a future CMS MVP: echoplex.

The scope of what a CMS is, what content is and who this is for could encompass a large post in itself. I have worked on a variety of CMS platforms for a variety of clients. From public utilities such as ConEd, Duke Energy and Evergy (neé KCP&L) to large multi-nationals like PepsiCo, ExxonMobil and L'Oréal to news sites like US Soccer. All have had very distinct needs with the basic need of delivering meaningful content to the consumer with engaging marketing content.

From a purely technical perspective, developing a marketing website is straightforward. However, anyone working with a multinational corporation will quickly discover. Software companies as varied as Netflix, Microsoft and Slack discovered rather late that having an effective means of distributing content without modifying code is surprisingly difficult. Simply what works from an engineering perspective limits the ability for copy editors, designers, data analysts and marketers to do their job effectively. Systems which empower the latter to make changes runs the risk of transferring too much power, and consequently code modification, into the hands of non-engineers. Hampering any effort are engineers themselves which design frameworks that allow rapid development but do not lend them a clean separation between code and content.
